# RChain Distribute Budgeting and Rewards (rchain-dbr)

The [RChain Cooperative](https://rchain.coop) is developing a
decentralized, economically sustainable public compute infrastructure.
As part of its efforts toward coordination at scale, it runs a [bounty
program][rb] with distributed budgeting and rewards. This `rchain-dbr`
code powers the web site where budgets and rewards are decided.
